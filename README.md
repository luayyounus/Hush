# Hush Messenger

#### Project Concept
  iOS Messenger that allows users send and receive messages quickly with or without signing up. The application uses Chat Rooms that can be accessed publicly Or privatly. Every time a chat room is created, a random authentication number wil be generated. That number can be shared to let others access the chat room. When the chat room creator decides no more users should join, they can lock the room. Every room is decided not to stay permenantly as the whole concept is to quick chat before the chat room expires.
